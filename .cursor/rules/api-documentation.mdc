# API documentation sync

When you add, change, or remove endpoints or controllers in `DAMS.API/Controllers/`:

- **Update docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md** in the same change:
  - New controller → add a section with the controller name, auth requirements, and an endpoint table (Method, Path, Description).
  - New action → add a row to the correct controller table.
  - Changed route, HTTP method, or auth → update the existing row.
  - Removed action/controller → remove the row or section.
- Keep the "Base URL & Authentication" and "Response format" sections accurate if they change.

This keeps the written API reference aligned with Swagger and the codebase.
